<p><strong>Secure Connection and Privacy Assurance</strong></p>
<p>Techducat Limited is committed to safeguarding your privacy on the
&quot;6°&quot; mobile application (the &quot;App&quot;). We want to
ensure that you have all the necessary information about how we
protect your privacy.</p>
<p><strong>1. Secure Connection:</strong> When you use the App, your
connection to our relay server at <a href="https://8.222.202.85:3001/" target="_new">https://8.222.202.85:3001</a>
is secured through HTTPS. This ensures that your data is transmitted
securely over the network, enhancing your privacy and data
protection.</p>
<p><strong>2. Unique Identifier:</strong> We assign you a unique
identifier on the peer-to-peer network, created using SHA-256
encryption, which generates a 64-character string that cannot be
reversed (decrypted). This identifier serves as your identity on the
network and is kept secure.</p>
<p><strong>3. Contact List:</strong> We encrypt your contact list using SHA-256
encryption, which generates a list of 64-character strings that cannot be
reversed (decrypted) just like your own identifier. These identifiers serve as
the identities of your peers on the network and are shared with other peers by
sending to the relay server at <a href="https://8.222.202.85:3001/" target="_new">https://8.222.202.85:3001</a> through an HTTP connection.</p>
<p><strong>4. Contact List Usage:</strong>The encrypted identifiers derived from the Contact List
serve as the identities of your peers on the network and are shared with other
peers by sending them to the relay server at <a href="https://8.222.202.85:3001/" target="_new">https://8.222.202.85:3001</a>
through an HTTP connection.</p>
<p><strong>5. Privacy Assurance:</strong> We take your privacy
seriously. We do not disclose your unique identifier (SHA-256 string)
to any third parties, as it is designed to be unrecoverable. Your
identity remains secure and anonymous on our network.</p>
<p><strong>6. Minimal Information:</strong> The only required
information for using the App is your cellphone number, which is
solely used for creating your unique identifier. We collect minimal
personal information, and we do not intentionally collect any
additional personal information from children under 13. The App is
available for users of all ages.</p>
<p><strong>7. Security Measures:</strong> We have implemented robust
security measures to protect your information, including your unique
identifier. The use of HTTPS ensures that your data is encrypted
during transmission, maintaining the security and anonymity of your
identity on our network.</p>
<p><strong>8. Changes to Our Policies:</strong> We may update our
policies to reflect changes in our practices or for other reasons.
You will be notified of any material changes through the App.</p>
